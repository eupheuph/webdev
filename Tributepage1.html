      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p class="about">
        Nelson Mandela was the son of Chief Henry Mandela of the Madiba clan of
        the Xhosa-speaking Tembu people. After his father’s death, young Nelson
        was raised by Jongintaba, the regent of the Tembu. Nelson renounced his
        claim to the chieftainship to become a lawyer. He attended South African
        Native College (later the University of Fort Hare) and studied law at
        the University of the Witwatersrand; he later passed the qualification
        exam to become a lawyer. In 1944 he joined the
        <b>African National Congress</b> (ANC), a Black-liberation group, and
        became a leader of its Youth League. That same year he met and married
        Evelyn Ntoko Mase. Mandela subsequently held other ANC leadership
        positions, through which he helped revitalize the organization and
        oppose the apartheid policies of the ruling National Party.

      <p class="about">
        Mandela’s antiapartheid activism made him a frequent target of the
        authorities. Starting in 1952, he was intermittently banned (severely
        restricted in travel, association, and speech). In December 1956 he was
        arrested with more than 100 other people on charges of treason that were
        designed to harass antiapartheid activists. Mandela went on trial that
        same year and eventually was acquitted in 1961. During the extended
        court proceedings, he divorced his first wife and married
        <b>Nomzamo Winifred Madikizela.</b>
      </p>
      <p class="about">
        Mandela did not seek a second term as South African president and was
        succeeded by Mbeki in 1999. After leaving office Mandela retired from
        active politics but maintained a strong international presence as an
        advocate of peace, reconciliation, and social justice, often through the
        work of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, established in 1999. He was a
        founding member of the Elders, a group of international leaders
        established in 2007 for the promotion of conflict resolution and problem
        solving throughout the world. In 2008 Mandela was feted with several
        celebrations in South Africa, Great Britain, and other countries in
        honour of his 90th birthday.
