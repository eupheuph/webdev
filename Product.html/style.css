/* So, I made this class for grid layout. It's direct from MDN (📌check link in description). Basically you just need to define a grid class, 
and the justify the spacing in the grid depending on the number of columns you want. You then give that grid class to a <div> that acts as the container 🍱 
and the set the internal components of your grid in groups of smaller <div>s.

One major challenger here would be that you have to have the same size of images. There's one that's toooooooooo big and it displaces the entire grid.👀 


The 🔗 link I've given will take you to the page detailing all about it. */
